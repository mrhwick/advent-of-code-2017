# Advent of Code 2017

### Intro

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I'm using [Go](https://golang.org/) for this year's AoC.

### Running my code

To make my solutions more portable, I've decided to use [gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes), which allows me to run Go code in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook through my browser. Gophernotes provides a public Docker image for even easier setup and execution of this great tool.

I've added a docker-compose.yml file to this repository, so once you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), you can check out my notebook solutions by running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
