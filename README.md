# Advent of Code 2017

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I'm using [Go](https://golang.org/) for this year's AoC.

To make my solutions more portable, I've decided to use [gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes), which allows me to run Go code in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook through my browser.
